## IOTA Donation Bot

A IOTA Tip bot without access to private keys or seed.

# How it works

People can donate to people, which are registered within the system. The register step is just to add a valid IOTA address, where the donations will be sent to. With the command /tip @username the bot will show the user's IOTA address as QR code and some more options, to copy the address or directly open it with IOTA Trinity.

### The donation bot will be available for Discord and Telegram.
